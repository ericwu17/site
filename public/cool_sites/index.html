      Cool Sites

    <h2>Search Engines</h2>

    Usually, I use Duckduckgo to find get answers. But there are a lot of interesting
    sites on the internet that doesn't get ranked highly on commercial search engines
    which I'd still like to find! So I will often search with the following search engines
    just for fun, to discover some interesting websites on the "small web":

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://wiby.me">wiby</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://search.marginalia.nu">marginalia</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://searchmysite.net">searchmysite</a></li>
    </ul>
