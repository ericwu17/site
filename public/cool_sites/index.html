    <h1>
      Cool Sites
    </h1>

    Here's a place where I plan to keep a collection of cool and helpful
    things I've seen on the internet.

    <h2>Search Engines for Fun</h2>

    Usually, I use Duckduckgo to find answers online. But there are a lot of interesting
    sites on the internet that don't get ranked highly on commercial search engines
    which I'd still like to find! So I will often search with the following search engines
    just for fun, to discover some interesting websites on the "small web":

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://wiby.me">wiby</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://search.marginalia.nu">marginalia</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://searchmysite.net">searchmysite</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Informational sites (for computer people)</h2>

    <h2>
      Shorthand
    </h2>
    <p>
      Shorthand is a random hobby of mine that seems a bit unrelated to my other interests.
      I write daily (by hand) using Gregg Shorthand, and I occasionally practice machine shorthand
      too.
      I think it's cool to learn about how court-reporters (and office secretaries back in the day),
      record text in a more efficient way.
    </p>
    <p>
      For written shorthand, I would recommend learning Gregg Simplified out of the Gregg
      series, since Simplified does not have too high of a memory burden, yet still allows
      for pretty fast speeds. You can find manuals online at places like
      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shorthand/">the shorthand subreddit</a>
      (also includes discussions about non-Gregg shorthands)
      or 
      <a href="https://greggshorthand.github.io/absimpli.html">this Gregg Shorthand Site</a>.

      Richard Liu made a cool
      <a href="https://greggdict.rliu.dev">online dictionary for Gregg Shorthand</a>,
      although you can also find dictionaries in pdf form online.
    </p>
    <p>
      For machine shorthand, <a href="https://www.openstenoproject.org/plover">Plover</a>
      is definitely the best steno software (commercial software is expensive!),
      and I would recommend the 
      <a href="https://stenomod.blogspot.com">tinymod</a> 
      as a machine (open source hardware!).
      <a href="https://www.openstenoproject.org/learn-plover">Learn Plover</a>
      is a good site to learn about machine shorthand theory.
