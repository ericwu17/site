  <body>
    <p id="firstparagraph">
        This is a page where I'll experiment with CSS.
        I'll use this as a personal reference of common styles in CSS.
        You should view the source of this page, and also see the stylesheet
        at <a href="demo.css">demo.css</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Some basic formatting of text in paragraphs</h2>

    <p>
        In a paragraph tag, you can use span tags to change the 
        <span id="one">color</span>
        as well as 
        <span id="two"">background color</span>,
        or 
        <span id="three">underline the text</span>.
        There are also HTML tags to do 
        <em>italics</em>, <strong>bold</strong>, and <u>underlining</u>.
    <p/>

    <h2>CSS box model</h2>
    <p>
        Recall <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model">the CSS box model</a>. 
        Each element in the DOM tree is basically a rectangle
        with a padding, border, and margin. See the image below. By the way, this
        image has a max-width of 600 pixels and is centered using <code>display:block</code>.
    </p>
    
    <img src="css_box_model.png" alt="Image of the CSS Box Model" class="image">

    <p>
        Here is 
        <span id="largespanthatwraps">
            a single span with a lot of text in it, which might wrap. 
            This span also has a border around it.
        </span>
        Resize the page and see what happens to the border. Huh, I guess the CSS box model
        doesn't ensure that each thing is a box after all? 
    </p>

    <h2>Links and Mouseovers</h2>

    <p>
        Check out these mouseover effects of these links:
        <a href="https://example.com" id="link1">link1</a>
        <a href="https://example.com" id="link2">link2</a>
        <a href="https://example.com" id="link3">link3</a>
        And note that for link2, I also changed the color. By default, these links
        are blue, and purple if you already visited the linked site. Both those colors
        are changeable. You can also remove the underline, like for link3.
    </p>

    <h2>Some whitespace issues</h2>

    <p>
        Check out the difference between these spans:
        <ul>
            <li>
                word <span class="simpleborder">word</span> word
            </li>
            <li>
                word<span class="simpleborder"> word</span> word
            </li>
            <li>
                word <span class="simpleborder">word </span>word
            </li>
            <li>
                word<span class="simpleborder"> word </span>word
            </li>
        </ul>
        I guess whitespace in HTML documents matters after all!
    </p>

    <!-- <h2>Putting the C in CSS</h2>

    <p>
        CSS stands for <em>cascading</em> style sheets. So how exactly
        do the cascade rules work?
        Note to self: come back here to calm down and experiment whenever I'm working on a page
        and end up frustrated because the CSS I thought should apply somewhere
        just isn't working.
    </p>

    <p id="light_blue_paragraph">
        Here's a paragraph with a background color. And in this paragraph, there's a single
        <span id="word_within_paragraph">word</span> that has a different background color.
    </p>
    TODO: more cascade rules! -->
