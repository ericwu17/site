    <h1>About this site</h1>

    <p>
        My name is Eric, and this is my site. 
        You should check out my 
        <a href="https://tslyriccompletion.com">Taylor Swift Lyric Completion Game</a>
        if you're a swiftie.
    </p>

    <p>
        This site was built using handwritten HTML and CSS, 
        because I wanted to better understand the basic
        building blocks of the web.
        I'm going for a really minimal look here, so I hope you don't mind.
