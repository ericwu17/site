    <h1>About this site</h1>

    <p>
        My name is Eric, and this is my site. 
        You should check out my

    <p>
        This site was built using handwritten HTML and CSS, 
        because I got sick of not understanding the basic
        building blocks of the web.
        I'm going for a really minimal look here.
    </p>
